# Linux setup convenience scripts

This repository contains a collection of convenience scripts I personally use to setup Linux desktop systems for myself and others. It contains instructions and scripts to install software, configure software, and set up a system for convenient usage.

The content of this repository is aimed to be compatible with general Ubuntu/Debian based distributions. Most stuff is tested on [POP!\_OS](https://pop.system76.com/) 22.04 and/or [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) 22.04.
